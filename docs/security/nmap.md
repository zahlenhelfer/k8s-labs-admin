# üß™ Exercise: Nmap Scan of a Kubernetes Server on Ubuntu 24.04

## üìù Objective

By the end of this exercise, you will:

* Understand which services Kubernetes exposes by default
* Use Nmap to discover open ports and service versions
* Identify security-relevant information from the scan

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* A **Kubernetes cluster** running (even a single-node cluster like `minikube` or `k3s`)
* A second **Ubuntu 24.04** server to act as the scanning machine
* Root or sudo access on both
* Nmap installed on the scanning machine

---

## üß© Part 1: Install Nmap

### On the Ubuntu scanning machine

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nmap
```

---

## üß© Part 2: Identify Target Information

### 1. Get the IP of the Kubernetes master node

On the Kubernetes server:

```bash
ip a
```

> Note the IP address (e.g., `192.168.122.10`) to scan from the other machine.

---

## üîç Part 3: Perform Nmap Scans

### 1. Basic port scan (top 1000 ports)

```bash
nmap 192.168.122.10
```

Expected open ports (for Kubernetes):

* **6443**: Kubernetes API server (HTTPS)
* **10250**: Kubelet API
* **10255**: (deprecated, read-only Kubelet API)
* **10257/10259**: Controller/Manager
* **2379‚Äì2380**: etcd ports

---

### 2. Full port scan (optional but slower)

```bash
sudo nmap -p- 192.168.122.10
```

---

### 3. Service version detection

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -p 6443,10250,2379,2380 192.168.122.10
```

This reveals software versions, e.g.:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
6443/tcp open  https     Kubernetes API server 1.28.2
```

---

### 4. OS detection (optional)

```bash
sudo nmap -O 192.168.122.10
```

---

### 5. Scan with Nmap NSE scripts for SSL/TLS

```bash
sudo nmap --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers -p 6443 192.168.122.10
```

This checks for:

* TLS version support
* Certificate details
* Weak ciphers

---

## üß™ Part 4: Interpreting Results

Answer the following:

1. What Kubernetes-related ports were open?
2. Was the Kubernetes API secured (HTTPS/TLS)?
3. Did any services reveal their version info?
4. Was etcd exposed externally (risk!)?

---

## ‚úÖ Part 5: Hardening Suggestions (Optional)

If etcd or the kubelet API is exposed:

* Restrict access via firewall
* Use authentication on exposed APIs
* Verify TLS configurations

Example:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.122.0/24 to any port 6443 proto tcp
```

## üìå Summary

| Scan Type      | Command                              | Purpose                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Basic Scan     | `nmap <IP>`                          | Quick overview                    |
| Full Port Scan | `nmap -p- <IP>`                      | All 65535 ports                   |
| Version Scan   | `nmap -sV -p <ports> <IP>`           | Get service versions              |
| TLS Analysis   | `nmap --script ssl-* -p <port> <IP>` | Analyze certificate + TLS support |
